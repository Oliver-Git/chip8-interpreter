# chip8-interpreter
A Chip-8 interpreter written in C, for my own learning purposes.

## Dependencies

This interpreter uses SDL2 for graphics, (and eventually) sound and I/O.

## Cross-Platform Support

Tested and working on Windows 10 Home version 2004, as well as Debian 10.<br/>
Currently I have no plans to support macOS, due to lack of testing hardware.

## License

This interpreter is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license, which can be viewed in the LICENSE file.
